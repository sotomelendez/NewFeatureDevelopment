# NewFeatureDevelopment

1. Run the project

The project is divided in 2 parts, frontend (in Angular) and backend (in Node.js).

To run the frontend use the commands:
npm install
ng serve

To run the backend use the commands:
npm install
npm start

Then you can access through http://localhost:4200/

2. Unit tests

The backend has some unit tests associated to the querying of files. 
However, there are missing tests for querying by file type, for example.
But Cucumber and Gherkin syntax provide great tools to test this.
